# LinkedIn-REACH-Mastermnd-Game by Tre Miller

This game was created using Python 3.9 on visual Studio 2022 IDE software. In order to run the program, simply download python 3.9 as well as any IDE software capable of interpreting python 3.9. such as Visual Studio 2022. Next, download my Mastermind Game 3 Final Draft File. If necessary simply, copy and paste the program into your IDE.  All files above were purposully non-separated. To ensure the gme runs correctly, please place all files in the same folder. Make sure all files are in the same directory before running the game. Finally, run the game. 

## Premise
In this game you play as an Avenger, one of Earth's Migthiest Heroes from Marvel Comics. In the Marvel Universe villainy is around every corner. Luckily, so is heroism. Depending on the difficulty selected, you will be tasked with stopping one of three villains (M.O.D.O.K, Dr. Doom, and Galactus) from carrying out their plans to harm the planet. To stop these maniacle masterminds you must hack their devices by decoding the secret sequence and save the day!

## Creative Implementations

Since I discussed how my passion for comic books ignited my flame for programming and technology in my application. I decided to use that same passion to fuel my creativity for this project. As such, I implemented many aspects of my passion into this game such as original soundtracks from Marvel video games, and voice overs from Marvel villains. I attempted to implement artwork representing these characters as well but ran into many bugs and decided to keep it simple. In addition, I implemented a difficulty setting as well as a timer which work hand in each other. Finally, I implemented a "play again" feature for those who just can't get enough.

## Thought Process

Initially, I wanted create the foundation of the mastermind game before adding auxilary features. Therefore, upon starting this project I created all of the main requrements first and used that as a foundational structure to let my creativity build upon. Once the main game was completed I added a timer and decided to use that as the mechanism to increase difficulty. Next, I added theme music that intensifies with each difficulty further pulling the player into the heat of the moment. Lastly, I added characters that correspond to the selected difficulty and that communicate and intimidate the player insulting them for losing or cursing the hero for foiling their plans. All these features came with alot of bugs of course. As a result, my final structure doesn't match the original. I spent a lot of time removing blocks that didnt work in favor of code that made the system run better together as a whole. Finaly, I separated the majority of the lines in my code for increased readability.
